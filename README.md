# Difficulties

Some difficulties I experienced was utilizing NodeJS and initializing a databse with JSON. This was apparent because I am not to fond of NodeJS and this was a completely new experience for me. With this being a new task, I understood the concept of it all but not when it was time to implement it on my own. I started off using NodeJS and then some things were not adding up mentally so I chose to do it the best way I could all while being able to explain what is happening and knowing where I went wrong.
